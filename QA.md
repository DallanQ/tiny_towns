[cloister-well-and-other-pt-per-each](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2205285/cloister-well-and-other-pt-per-each)

>  What is the meaning of the cards that have the scoring, 1pt each for a condition.
> Example: 
>  Cloister
> 1 pt for each cloister in the corners.
> If you have 4 cloisters in the corner, is it 16 pts or 4 pts?

Building Clarifications on page 7 of the rulebook explain that "Cloisters not placed in a corner will still score 1 point for each other Cloister placed in a corner. The maximum a Cloister can score is 4 points."

So, each Cloister can be worth up to 4 points. Four Cloisters in the corners plus one additional Cloister anywhere else on the board would be worth a total of 20 points.

[how-do-i-score-duplicates-of-these-buildings](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2205753/how-do-i-score-duplicates-of-these-buildings)

> Do this buildings score individually? That is to say:
> 2 FARMS with 4 cottages on your board, 12 or 24 points?
> 2 ORCHARDS each with 2 cottages in the same row or column, 6 or 12
and, what if they share one cottage, 6, 9, or 12 points?
> 2 GRANARIES same as above.
> 2 GREENHOUSES with 3 cottages on your board. Do you score the contiguous group of cottages for 9 or 18 points?
> 2 TAVERNS, 5 or 10 points? 4 TAVERNS, 14 or 56?
> 2 ALMSHOUSES, 5 or 10 points? 4 ALMSHOUSES, 15 or 60?

Every building scores individually, except for things like Tavern which obviously score collectively.
Farms do not score at all; they feed cottages.
A cottage scores if it is fed. It doesn’t matter if it’s fed twice. The cottage doesn’t say “Score points each time it’s fed.” So you look at your board and say “This farm is gonna feed those 4 cottages, so they each score. This other farm is gonna feed those other 4 cottages so they score. This 9th cottage is left unfed so it doesn’t score.” Etc.
In your example, 2 Taverns are worth 5 points total, and 2 Almshouses are worth 5 points total.

No; as long as it happens after you have constructed opaleye's watch. If they constructed those buildings before you constructed opaleye's watch.
A turn works like this:
1) resource is named
2) Resources are placed
3) buildings are constructed
4) Abilities are triggered

So if you are playing the town hall variant, you aren't taking turns to be the master builder.

The point is that it is worth 4 points. It adds a tiny restriction on you in return.
If you put a resource on the Bank, you can't call for that resource when you are the master builder, you can still add it to your town if other players call it.
In the town hall variant, you can't choose that resource every 3rd turn when it is your choice on what resource to take.

Yes, when you replace with Architect's Guild you still follow any construction requirements for things like Bank and Factory.

> Specific to Architect's Guild: can you chose to "replace" a building with one of the same kind?

You cannot replace a building with one of the same kind, but you could do this: Replace a Bank (with a glass) with an Almshouse. Replace an Almshouse with a Bank (with glass or any other resource). So if you are looking for a way to switch up the resource on Factory or Bank, this is a valid way to do it.
On a different note, the number of buildings you replace can be anywhere from 0 to 2.

First you check the individual condition for each building.
In the case of cottages just check if it is fed or not. Perhaps it doesn't matter how many farms can feed it.
In your example: for each cottage, you check if it is fed? If so, then add 3 points. So if you have 6 cottages and they are all fed, then you'd get 18 points.

> When talking about the resource cube put on the factory when built: are you allowed to switch to another resource only once during the game or are you allowed to use this power again during the remainder of the game?

As often as you wish.
Just to be clear: you place one resource on the Factory when it is constructed. Whenever the Master Builder names this type of resource, you may place a different resource yourself, although you cannot make this change when you are the Master Builder.
For example:
(1) You construct the Factory and put a glass cube on it.
(2) Player A is the Master Builder and names Wheat. You must Place Wheat.
(3) Player B becomes the Master Builder and names Glass - you may play any resource.
(4) You become the Master Builder and name Glass - you must place Glass.
For the rest of the game, every time another player is the Master Builder and names glass, you may place a different resource or glass.

You don't need to announce what you are building every time you place a material.

This is just in case someone wants to check whether or not all materials are placed in the correct order.
Part of the fun is trying to guess what your friends are trying to build, so you can mess up with their materials.

Barrett Castle is only 5 points max if its fed. However, it counts as two cottages only in reference to other building scoring like Chapel, Temple, Well, etc. That score per adjacent cottage.
So its worth more than 5 points in the sense that it makes other buildings score more, assuming those buildings are even in the game.

It sounds as if you were not playing the Trading Post correctly.
However, the rules states that "you can use multiple Trading Posts to construct a single building, but at least 1 non-Trading Post resource must be used."
Granted, with three of them and the Obelisk one building could be built every turn, but it would be limited to one a turn. It's a very strong combo but of course building it all is not trivial.

Yes a single market still counts as 1VP. It will always be in the same row/column as itself.
Off the top of my head the Tailor reads 1vp + 1 vp per... as the Tailor doesn't have to be or may not be in the additional scoring area (which I think was the middle 4 squares). So a single tailor in the corner of the board would be 1vp, while a single tailor in the middle of the board would be 2vp. If you had 2 tailors, 1 in the middle and one on the edge they would be worth 2vp each, while if both were in the middle of the board they would be 3vp each.

In Town Hall mode all effects that say when another player as master builder will refer to the cards from the deck.

It refers to other players naming resources apply to rounds in which the Mayor draws a Resource card. Perhaps you can think of it as when the mayor is drawing a card, it's someone else's turn and those abilities apply. When it's a free-pick, it's like you are the master builder in a normal game and hence those abilities don't apply.

The Palace can score at most 8 points, by having 4 different building types orthogonally adjacent to it. Unique simply means that you can only score for different buildings e.g. if you have more than one Cottage adjacent, you’ll only score for one of them. The Palace doesn’t count as it is not adjacent to itself.
The explanation for the Theatre in the rules, explains what unique means in the context of this game.

> Do the grey structure cards count as a building?
For example: when you have the Archive of 2nd era monument it scores a point for every unique building. Do you include the grey structure as a unique building and therefore score a point for it?

Yes, they're still buildings in a game sense even when in a real-world sense you wouldn't call a well or a statue a building.

Under Additional Rules Page 5:
Resource cubes and buildings are unlimited. If you run out, substitute some other marker.

[scoring-the-market](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2392394/scoring-the-market)

> If you have 4 markets in a row, does it score 4 points for each market, for a total of 16 points?

Yes, 16 points.
You have to ask yourself for each market individually:
How many Markets are in the same row or column?
In this case, the answer is 3 others.
So this market scores 4 points.
Now we go on to the next market ...
You see where this is going? So yes 16 points.

> While playing Tiny towns, I built a factory and as we played it, I could only put 1 of the 5 cubes that I used to build it (red, brown, grey) over the building, is that true? or can i choose any resource including blue and yellow?

You can choose any resources.

[feeding-cottages-when-does-it-happen](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2472623/feeding-cottages-when-does-it-happen)

> Do you feed cottage with your red buildings upon constructing the red building, or during endgame scoring?

"Feeding" is an abstract concept in this game, it represents a condition that you need to meet in order to score points for cottages at the end of the game but is "active" as soon as the condition is met.
So the answer is during the endgame scoring.
Otherwise you could not build the red buildings before the cottages.

The only building you can use as a resource is the Trading Post

When we play with town hall variant, on the 3rd card which is your wild card, you are not allowed to take a cube of the same color as one on your bank. By your description i am not sure if you're playing the bank correctly. The color cube that you put on there can no longer be freely chosen by you.

> I'm having trouble understanding Barrett Castle. So you get 5 points if fed. How do you feed the Castle? We had the Greenhouse card in play at the time.
> What does it mean when it says it "counts as two cottages"? Do you get extra points as if it were two fed cottages, three points each?

"It is fed the same way a cottage is fed, which depends on which red building is in play. 
For example: if you had the red building that feeds cottages in the 8 spaces around it, you'll have to build the Barrett Castle in one of those 8 spaces."
The 2 cottage thing refers to buildings like Chapel or Temple. Temple needs to be adjacent to 2 fed cottages, if it's adjacent to a fed Barret's Castle, that would count.

 it's simply the largest group of buildings orthogonally adjacent to each other, so all 5.
 
[tiny-towns-rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2211946/tiny-towns-rules)

> When placing colors in my town, while trying to build, say a cottage or whatever, another player may call out a color I don't want. Not only that but I may have to place it such that it can build something other than what I intended.
> In such a case would I be forced to build something I don't want?

The rules do indeed give the answer Under point 3 of the Round Overview: "Players may construct any buildings for which they have the matching resources in the correct shape". In addition, under Completing Your Town, it says "When your town is filled with resources and you cannot (or choose not to) construct any buildings."

[removing-resource-cubes](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2487511/removing-resource-cubes)

> Once placed on the board, is there no way to remove a cube from the board?

The idea of leaving resource cubes on the board adds the aspect of planning. If you could remove resource cubes, I believe it lessens considerably the importance of decisions you make.
So normally you are not going to remove a cube from the board. But, if you want to make a house rule to lighten the mood of the game, feel free to do so.

No. Barrett Castle only counts as two cottages when scoring.

>  We were playing tiny towns as a family when my son decided to not build and hoard a resource. When it was time to call, we did called but not available. So what do we do?

Additional Rules From page 5 says "Resource cubes and buildings are unlimited. If you run out, substitute some other marker. Perhaps you would need to substitute that resource with something else (Maybe with other game pieces).

[solo-refill-resource-timing](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2497254/solo-refill-resource-timing)

>  In Solo mode, i wanted to confirm the timing of replacing the chosen resource card with a new card.
> This is how I think it works:
> 1. Choose a resource from the 3 available cards
> 2. Take resource cube and place it
> 3. Put chosen card to bottom of deck and draw a new card
> 4. Build any buildings if you wish
> If the card instead gets replaced after the building phase am i to build something or wait.

The Rulebook is clear on this: Drawing a new card is the last step.
Quote:
You choose to place any 1 of the 3 resources shown in your town and construct buildings as normal. Then place the corresponding card face-down on the bottom of the draw pile and draw a new Resource card to replace it.

[warehouse-storage-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2353783/warehouse-storage-question)

> Are you not allowed to use the warehouse if you are the master builder for both placing and swapping?
> If this is the case, in the card draw variant would the time you get to pick any resource be equivalent to being master build and prevent you from using the warehouse?

Yes and yes.
Basically, the idea is that "whenever you may not choose the resource anyway" you may use the warehouse.

[5-banks](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2202189/5-banks)

> What happens when you have 5 banks and are last player to pass?

If you have 5 Banks and are the last player still going, then you would be forced to declare your town "complete."
This is an exception to the normal game end trigger.

> Does having zero of a building type give you a point for the public house, as zero is an even number.?
> Public House: “1 point per unique building type, you have an even number in your town.”

No. The rules state "per unique building type you HAVE an even number of"
While zero is an even number, if there is a building type there are zero of in your town, or rather none in your town, then you don't "have" any in your town.

[barrett-castle-too-powerful](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2172550/barrett-castle-too-powerful)

> Is Barrett Castle too powerful? For instance: In our first game, it earned a player 17 points. The card itself has a bonus of 5 points if fed. Then, since it is worth 2 cottages, another 6 points since it was fed. This seems to be doubling-dipping. The player was smart to also have built 3 chapels, gaining 6 more points from this “2 cottage” equivalent.
> Are we misunderstanding the scoring for this monument card?

Barrett Castle is only worth 5 points if fed (no additional points for counting as two Cottages). It is treated as two Cottages for the purposes of things like Chapel and Well, however.

> For the purposes of scoring a theater, let's call it Theater A. If you have another theater (Theater B) in the same row or column, does Theater B count as a "unique" building when scoring Theater A? And vice versa?

No, Theaters don't count.
