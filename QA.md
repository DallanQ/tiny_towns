[cloister-well-and-other-pt-per-each](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2205285/cloister-well-and-other-pt-per-each)
>  What is the meaning of the cards that have the scoring, 1pt each for a condition.
> Example:
> Cloister
> 1 pt for each cloister in the corners.
> If you have 4 cloisters in the corner, is it 16 pts or 4 pts?

Building Clarifications on page 7 of the rulebook explain the Cloister as so: "Cloisters not placed in a corner will still score 1 point for each other Cloister placed in a corner. The maximum a Cloister can score is 4 points."

So, each Cloister can be worth up to 4 points. Four Cloisters in the corners plus one additional Cloister anywhere else on the board would be worth a total of 20 points.

> Do this buildings score individually?
> 2 FARMS with 4 cottages on your board, 12 or 24 points?
> 2 ORCHARDS each with 2 cottages in the same row or column, 6 or 12
and, what if they share one cottage, 6, 9, or 12 points?
> 2 GRANARYS same as above.
> 2 GREENHOUSES with 3 cottages on your board. Do you score the contiguous group of cottages for 9 or 18 points?
> 2 TAVERNS, 5 or 10 points? 4 TAVERNS, 14 or 56?
> 2 ALMSHOUSES, 5 or 10 points? 4 ALMSHOUSES, 15 or 60?

Every building scores individually, except for things like Tavern which obviously score collectively.
Farms do not score at all; they feed cottages.
A cottage scores if it is fed. It doesn’t matter if it’s fed twice. The cottage doesn’t say “Score points each time it’s fed.” So you look at your board and say “This farm is gonna feed those 4 cottages, so they each score. This other farm is gonna feed those other 4 cottages so they score. This 9th cottage is left unfed so it doesn’t score.” Etc.
In your example, 2 Taverns are worth 5 points total, and 2 Almshouses are worth 5 points total.

> Are the cubes on factories just there for the "you can pick another color" power? Or are they also permanent resources that can be used in patterns for other structures?

They are only there for the pick another color power. It is only when the dark blue card is a Trading Post that you can use the building itself as a "wild" of any cube color in the spot that the trading post occupies.

[yet-another-factory-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2327785/yet-another-factory-question)
> Building a factory lets you place one cube on it and whenever that cube is called out (or drawn) you may replace it with any other. Does this mean that if you build 5 factories, every pull will be any resource you want?

Yes, but its not a good strategy. You burn 5 spaces that dont score points.

[bank](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2613594/bank)
> What's the point of building a Bank when you limit yourself and can't name a colour when you are a Master Builder? You can't use a resource which you put on a Bank.

The purpose of building the Bank is that it scores you relatively higher than other buildings. The downside is you can't call for that specific resource anymore, so each Bank you build limits you further.

> The text on Opaleye's Watch states that you place one of the buildings on the card "Whenever player on the left or right of you constructs one of those buildings."
> Does this apply to buildings constructed in the round in which Opaleye’s Watch was constructed?

No; as long as it happens after you have constructed opaleye's watch. If they constructed those buildings before you constructed opaleye's watch.
A turn works like this:
1) resource is named
2) Resources are placed
3) buildings are constructed
4) Abilities are triggered
Since you choose the buildings in step 4 they wouldn't get to trigger buildings from step 3

[further-clarification-on-the-bank](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2460501/further-clarification-on-the-bank)
> Why would you build the Bank, other than a four point bonus reason. It seems to indicate you can put a resource on there but for what reason? If you can't pick a resource of your choice when your chosen resource is called out, why do it? Also, it says you can't choose a resource if you are master builder. So if you are playing the town hall variant, you aren't taking turns to be the master builder.

The point is that it is worth 4 points. It adds a tiny restriction on you in return.
If you put a resource on the Bank, you can't call for that resource when you are the master builder, you can still add it to your town if other players call it.
In the town hall variant, you can't choose that resource every 3rd turn when it is your choice on what resource to take.

Yes, Nothing forbid to use the same trading post to build two (or more) separate buildings on the same turn so you can.

[placing-and-replacing-buildings-grove-university-a](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2212069/placing-and-replacing-buildings-grove-university-a)
> When you are instructed by Grove University or Architect's Guild to place or replace a building, if you choose to place a building such as the Bank or Factory, do you still put a resource cube on it?

Yes, when you replace with Architect's Guild you still follow any construction requirements for things like Bank and Factory.

> Specific to Architect's Guild: can you chose to "replace" a building with one of the same kind?

You cannot replace a building with one of the same kind, but you could do this: Replace a Bank (with a glass) with an Almshouse. Replace an Almshouse with a Bank (with glass or any other resource). So if you are looking for a way to switch up the resource on Factory or Bank, this is a valid way to do it.
On a different note, the number of buildings you replace can be anywhere from 0 to 2.

No, once a building is constructed in a square, you cannot place any more resource cubes in that square.

[scoring-multiples-of-same-building-farm-chapel-and](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2201817/scoring-multiples-of-same-building-farm-chapel-and)
> Can I reuse cottages when scoring multiples of the same building?
> Example: If I have 6 cottages fed by 2 farms would I score 24 pts (each farm feeding any 4 cottages for 12 pts), or 18 pts (one farm feeds 4 cottages for 12 pts and the other farm feeds the remaining two cottages for 6 pts).

First you check the individual condition for each building.
In the case of cottages just check "is it fed or not".
It doesn't matter how many farms can feed it.
In your example: So for each cottage you check- is it fed? If so, then add 3 points. So if you have 6 cottages and they are all fed, then you'd get 18 points.

> Greenhouse specifies it feeds one contiguous group of cottages. If there is two single cottage (not contiguous) and two greenhouses, would those cottages be considered fed with each greenhouse feeding one cottage. Or do you have to have 2+ contiguous cottages for them to be fed at all?

Generally, each building in Tiny Towns has a single application. So both Cottages are fed because each of the two Greenhouses- feeding a group (as small as 1) of contiguous Cottages, is feeding a separate group.

> About the ressource cube put on the factory when built: are you allowed to switch to another ressource only once during the game or are you allowed to use this power again during the remainder of the game?

As often as you wish.
Just to be clear: you place one resource on the Factory when it is constructed. Whenever the Master Builder names this type of resource, you may place a different resource yourself, although you cannot make this change when you are the Master Builder.
For example:
(1) You construct the Factory and put a glass cube on it.
(2) Player A is the Master Builder and names Wheat. You must Place Wheat.
(3) Player B becomes the Master Builder and names Glass - you may play any resource.
(4) You become the Master Builder and name Glass - you must place Glass.
For the rest of the game, every time another player is the Master Builder and names glass, you may place a different resource or glass.

Yes, you can build four wells near to a cottage. It would give you 4 points in total from the combined wells. You can also build four cottages adjacent to a single well, earning you 4 points in total from that well.

You don't need to announce what you are building every time you place a material. You just announce what you will build once you have all pieces in place and they are ready to be replaced by the building. This is just in case someone wants to check whether or not all materials are placed in the correct order.
Part of the fun is trying to guess what your friends are trying to build, so you can mess up with their materials

Barrett Castle is only 5 points max if its fed. However, it counts as two cottages only in reference to other building scorings like Chapel, Temple, Well, etc. That score per adjacent cottage.
So its worth more than 5 points in the sense that it makes other buildings score more, assuming those buildings are even in the game.
