[cloister-well-and-other-pt-per-each](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2205285/cloister-well-and-other-pt-per-each)
>  What is the meaning of the cards that have the scoring, 1pt each for a condition.
> Example:
> Cloister
> 1 pt for each cloister in the corners.
> If you have 4 cloisters in the corner, is it 16 pts or 4 pts?

Building Clarifications on page 7 of the rulebook explain the Cloister as so: "Cloisters not placed in a corner will still score 1 point for each other Cloister placed in a corner. The maximum a Cloister can score is 4 points."

So, each Cloister can be worth up to 4 points. Four Cloisters in the corners plus one additional Cloister anywhere else on the board would be worth a total of 20 points.

and, what if they share one cottage, 6, 9, or 12 points?

> 2 TAVERNS, 5 or 10 points? 4 TAVERNS, 14 or 56?
> 2 ALMSHOUSES, 5 or 10 points? 4 ALMSHOUSES, 15 or 60?

Every building scores individually, except for things like Tavern which obviously score collectively.
Farms do not score at all; they feed cottages.
A cottage scores if it is fed. It doesn’t matter if it’s fed twice. The cottage doesn’t say “Score points each time it’s fed.” So you look at your board and say “This farm is gonna feed those 4 cottages, so they each score. This other farm is gonna feed those other 4 cottages so they score. This 9th cottage is left unfed so it doesn’t score.” Etc.
In your example, 2 Taverns are worth 5 points total, and 2 Almshouses are worth 5 points total.

No; as long as it happens after you have constructed opaleye's watch. If they constructed those buildings before you constructed opaleye's watch.
A turn works like this:
1) resource is named
2) Resources are placed
3) buildings are constructed
4) Abilities are triggered
Since you choose the buildings in step 4 they wouldn't get to trigger buildings from step 3

So if you are playing the town hall variant, you aren't taking turns to be the master builder.

The point is that it is worth 4 points. It adds a tiny restriction on you in return.
If you put a resource on the Bank, you can't call for that resource when you are the master builder, you can still add it to your town if other players call it.
In the town hall variant, you can't choose that resource every 3rd turn when it is your choice on what resource to take.

Yes, when you replace with Architect's Guild you still follow any construction requirements for things like Bank and Factory.

> Specific to Architect's Guild: can you chose to "replace" a building with one of the same kind?

You cannot replace a building with one of the same kind, but you could do this: Replace a Bank (with a glass) with an Almshouse. Replace an Almshouse with a Bank (with glass or any other resource). So if you are looking for a way to switch up the resource on Factory or Bank, this is a valid way to do it.
On a different note, the number of buildings you replace can be anywhere from 0 to 2.

First you check the individual condition for each building.
In the case of cottages just check "is it fed or not".
It doesn't matter how many farms can feed it.
In your example: So for each cottage you check- is it fed? If so, then add 3 points. So if you have 6 cottages and they are all fed, then you'd get 18 points.

> About the ressource cube put on the factory when built: are you allowed to switch to another ressource only once during the game or are you allowed to use this power again during the remainder of the game?

As often as you wish.
Just to be clear: you place one resource on the Factory when it is constructed. Whenever the Master Builder names this type of resource, you may place a different resource yourself, although you cannot make this change when you are the Master Builder.
For example:
(1) You construct the Factory and put a glass cube on it.
(2) Player A is the Master Builder and names Wheat. You must Place Wheat.
(3) Player B becomes the Master Builder and names Glass - you may play any resource.
(4) You become the Master Builder and name Glass - you must place Glass.
For the rest of the game, every time another player is the Master Builder and names glass, you may place a different resource or glass.

You don't need to announce what you are building every time you place a material.

This is just in case someone wants to check whether or not all materials are placed in the correct order.
Part of the fun is trying to guess what your friends are trying to build, so you can mess up with their materials

Barrett Castle is only 5 points max if its fed. However, it counts as two cottages only in reference to other building scorings like Chapel, Temple, Well, etc. That score per adjacent cottage.
So its worth more than 5 points in the sense that it makes other buildings score more, assuming those buildings are even in the game.

You can use multiple Trading Posts to construct a single building, but at least 1 non-Trading Post resource must be used.
Granted, with three of them and the Obelisk one building could be built every turn, but it would be limited to one a turn. It's a very strong combo but of course building it all is not trivial.

The answer is in the rules quote(First line) “when you cannot, or choose not to construct any buildings, your town is completed.” So you could just forfeit the game whenever you want.

Yes a single market still counts as 1VP. It will always be in the same row/column as itself.
Off the top of my head the Tailor reads 1vp + 1 vp per... as the Tailor doesn't have to be or may not be in the additional scoring area (which I think was the middle 4 squares). So a single tailor in the corner of the board would be 1vp, while a single tailor in the middle of the board would be 2vp. If you had 2 tailors, 1 in the middle and one on the edge they would be worth 2vp each, while if both were in the middle of the board they would be 3vp each.

That's correct, you can only put one cube on a factory when you build it. For the remainder of the game when somebody calls that resource, you may choose to place a different resource instead.
