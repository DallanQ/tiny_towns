## Setup (page 2)

1. Give each player a player board.

2. Leave the Resource cards in the box (unless you are playing the Town Hall rules or Solo variant).

3. Place the Cottage card (with the Symbol On the Back) Face-Up In The Center Of the table.

4. Sort the remaining Building cards into separate piles by the symbols on the back.

5. Shuffle each pile of 4 cards.

6. Draw 1 card from each pile and place them face-up next to the Cottage card, so they are visible to all players.

7. Place the remaining Building cards back into the box – they will not be used for this game. For your first game, it is recommended to use the set of Building cards shown on the right.

8. Place the wooden Resource cubes and buildings (but NOT monuments) in a general supply where all players can reach them.

There are 5 different resources:

> Wood

> Wheat

> Brick

> Glass

> Stone

9. The starting player is the player who most recently constructed something (in real life). Give that player the Master Builder hammer.

10. Shuffle the Monument cards and deal each player 2 Monument cards face-down, which they should look at but keep secret. Players should select 1 Monument card to keep and discard the other to the box, face-down.

11. Give each player 1 wooden monument, which they should keep next to their Monument card. Return any remaining monuments to the box — they will not be available to players in this game. For your first game, you may want to play without monuments.

### recommended cards for first play (page 2)

> Chapel

> Farm

> Tavern

> Well

> Theater

> Factory

## Monuments (page 3)

A monument is a special type of building that can only be constructed by the player holding that card. Players may only construct their monuments once. Monuments may be constructed in any round, just like a normal building (see Building Construction Rules). Upon constructing a monument, the player should read the Monument card aloud, place it face-up in front of them, and resolve any immediate effects. If the card grants an ability, that ability takes effect immediately and only applies to the card's holder. Scoring for Monument cards is resolved at game end. Monuments are not a part of the general supply.

## Round Overview (page 4)

1. The Master Builder names a type of resource. (Wood, Wheat, Brick, Glass, or Stone)

2. All players MUST take a cube of this resource and place it in an empty square in their town grid. Players do this simultaneously.

### Resource Placement (page 4)

- Resources may never be moved to a different square after being placed.

- Resources can only be removed by constructing a building.

- Only 1 resource or building may occupy a square.

- When resources are removed from a board, they go back to the general supply.

3. Players may construct any buildings for which they have the matching resources in the correct shape. Players do this simultaneously and should announce what building they are constructing.

4. Once all players have placed their resources and constructed buildings, a new round begins. The Master Builder token passes to the player on the left.

The new Master Builder should always wait until all players are ready before naming the next resource. Players can show that they are still thinking by holding up their resource cube until they place it.

After a resource has been placed, players have until the next resource is named to construct any buildings.

### The cavern rule (page 4)

Building a Tiny Town is difficult. If this is one of your first games, or if you want a little more flexibility in your town, we recommend that you play with the Cavern rule. Throughout the game, players have the option of placing up to 2 resources named by other players off to the side of their board. These resources score no points or penalties at the end of the game. Players must decide when it is most advantageous to use this special ability!

## Building Construction Rules

Building layouts may be mirrored/flipped and rotated, as long as the configuration of resources remains the same. To construct a building:

1. Remove the correct resources in the correct shape from your board and place them back in the general supply.

A resource can only be used to construct 1 building — in other words, every building requires all of its resources.

Buildings may never be moved to a different square after being placed.

2. Take the matching wooden building from the general supply.

Buildings do not have to be constructed as soon as its resources are in place. Players may wait as many rounds as they want to construct a building.

Any player can construct any of the buildings (except other players' monuments). Building cards are not replaced when players construct buildings.

3. Place it in 1 of the squares that was occupied by the resources removed.

Players may construct multiple buildings at once.

Players cannot construct a building immediately after a resource has been named without physically placing the resource cube in their town first.

### Building Construction Example (page 4)

> An image of Chapel.

> An image of placing a blue cube between 2 grey cubes and another blue cube.
If John places a blue Resource cube here, he may choose to construct a Chapel.

> An image of the blue cube placed.
BLAM! Now John is ready to construct a Chapel.

> An image of all the cubes(blue and grey) removed.
 John removes the 4 cubes and can place the wooden Chapel in any of the squares they occupied. He chooses the rightmost square. Resources and other buildings may no longer be placed in that square.

> Arranging the 4 cubes in between each other; a blue cube, then a grey cube then a blue cube then a grey cube.
This is allowed, since the configuration of the cubes matches the Chapel card.

> Image of the 4 cubes not between each other.
This isnt allowed, since the configuration of the cubes does not match the Chapel card.

### Feeding your cottages (page 5)

Remember! Cottages must be fed by buildings, to be worth 3 points. players may construct cottages before or after constructing buildings, but unfed Cottages at game end score 0 points.

## Completing Your Town (page 5)

When your town is filled with resources and you cannot (or choose not to) construct any buildings, your town is completed. You are out of the game and can start calculating your score. (You no longer take turns naming resources as the Master Builder.)

Note: A player may continue to place resources and name resources as the Master Builder as long as they have space for the resources in their town, even if it will not be possible for them to construct any buildings.

If only 1 player is left, that player can continue to name resources as the sole Master Builder until their town is completed.

## Game End (page 5)

When all players' towns are completed, the game ends immediately. Remove all remaining resource cubes (except from Warehouses). Each empty square is worth -1 points. Players add their points for each building in thier town and any penalties to calculate their final score. The player with the most points wins.

In the case of a tie, the tied player who had the fewest turns as Master Builder wins. If there is still a tie, the player with the fewest empty squares wins. If there is still a tie, the player with the most Cottages wins. If there is still a tie, the tied players share the victory.

## Additional Rules (page 5)
- Resource cubes and buildings are unlimited. If you run out, substitute Some Other Marker.

- Unfed Cottages at game end remain on the board but score no Some other buildings (such as Wells) still score points from unfed Cottages.

- "Adjacent" means up, down, left, and right.

- It is possible to have a negative score.

Buildings Never Score points On Their Own.

## Scoring Example

Playing without monuments, this board would score:
| | | | |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| 2 Wells | image of a well | 1 point for each adjacent cottage (fed and unfed). | That gives 5 points |
| 4 Fed Cottages | image of a cottage | 3 points for each fed cottage. 1 Farm only feeds 4 Cottages, so only 4 of the 5 constructed Cottages score points. | That gives 12 points. |
  
| Chapel | image of a chapel | 1 point for each of the 4 fed cottages and 0 points for the 1 unfed cottage. | That gives 4 points. |

| 3 Taverns | image of a Tavern | 9 points for having constructed 3 taverns. |That gives 9 points. |

| Bakery | image of a Bakery | 3 points for being adjacent to a farm. | That gives 3 points. |

| Warehouse | image of a warehouse | -1 point for each resource it holds. | That gives -3 points. |

| 2 Empty squares |  | -1 point each. | That gives -2 points. |

| | | | TOTAL POINTS: 28 points. |

## Town Hall Rules (page 6)

Town Hall is a different way to play Tiny Towns that introduces the Resource deck and changes the way resources are selected during the game.

Assign 1 player to be the Mayor, who will draw Resource cards to determine which resource all players will place.

### Gameplay (page 6)

Shuffle the 15 Resource cards to form a draw pile, and discard the top 5 cards face-down to a discard pile.

1. The Mayor starts the game by drawing the top Resource card from the draw pile and placing it face-up on the table. Players must place the resource shown on the card in their town.

2. After all players have placed their resources, the Mayor places the Resource card on the discard pile and draws a new Resource card for the second round, placing it face-up on the table. All players once again place the indicated resource in their town, and the Mayor places the Resource card on the discard pile.

3. In the third round, players individually choose 1 of the 5 resources from the supply to place in their town. (Players do this simultaneously.)

In subsequent rounds repeat this pattern, with the Mayor drawing 1 Resource card each for every first and second round, and players choosing a resource individually for every third round. When a Resource card needs to be drawn and the draw pile is empty, the Mayor shuffles the cards in the discard pile to form a new draw pile and again discards the top 5 cards face-down. Play continues until the end conditions of the standard game are met.

Note: In this, Building and Monument cards that refer to other players naming resources (Factory, Warehouse, Statue of the Bondmaker) apply to rounds in which the Mayor draws a Resource card. The ongoing effect of Bank applies to every third round, in which players have their choice of resource (that is, players can no longer choose from the supply in those rounds the resources placed on any of their Banks).

If a player builds the monument Fort Ironweed, that player may no longer take and place resources every third round, in which players have their choice of resource, unless that player is the only player remaining.

## Solo Variant (page 6)

There is no Master Builder in the Solo variant.

### Setup 

Remove the following cards from the game when playing the solo variant:

The Inn, The bank, Fort Ironweed and Opaleye'S Watch.

### Solo rules 

Shuffle the 15 Resource cards to form a draw pile and reveal the top 3 cards. You choose to place any 1 of the 3 resources shown in your town and construct buildings as normal. Then place the corresponding card face-down on the bottom of the draw pile and draw a new Resource card to replace it.

Note: In this variant, Building and Monument cards that refer to other players naming resources (Factory, Warehouse, Statue of the Bondmaker) apply to choosing resources from the resource deck.

The game ends as normal, when your town is completed (your town is filled with resources and you cannot or choose not to construct any buildings).

Check your score against the chart below:

|Points(VP)|Skill Level Achieved|
|----------|--------------------|
| 38 or more | Master Architect |
| 32-37 | Town Planner |
| 25-31 | Engineer |
| 18-24 | Carpenter |
| 10-17 | Builder's Apprentice |
| 9 or less | Aspiring Architect |

Trading Posts can be used in the layout of any future buildings. When you construct a building that used a Trading Post as a resource, you do not remove the Trading Post from its square. You can use multiple Trading Posts to construct a single building, but at least 1 non-Trading Post resource must be used.

## Warehouse

You can store up to 3 resources with a Warehouse by physically placing the cubes on the building. When another player names a resource that you do not want, place the resource on your Warehouse. You may remove a resource from your Warehouse and place it in an empty square on your board when you do this. You can never remove a resource without placing a new resource on the Warehouse. As a result, the number of resources on a Warehouse will never decrease.
