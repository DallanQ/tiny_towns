## OBJECTIVE (page 1)

Your town is represented by a 4x4 grid, on which you will place Resource cubes in specific layouts to construct
buildings. Each building scores points (icon of a green diamond in a yellow circle) in a unique way. When no player can place any more resources or construct any buildings, the game ends, and any squares without a building are worth -1 points.

The player with the most points wins

## Setup (page 2)

1. Give each player a player board.

2. Leave the Resource cards in the box (unless you are playing the Town Hall rules or Solo variant).

3. Place the Cottage card (with the (icon of a blue house) Symbol On the Back) Face-Up In The Center Of the table.

4. Sort the remaining Building cards into separate piles by the symbols on the back.

5. Shuffle each pile of 4 cards.

6. Draw 1 card from each pile and place them face-up next to the Cottage card, so they are visible to all players.

7. Place the remaining Building cards back into the box – they will not be used for this game. For your first game, it is recommended to use the set of Building cards shown on the right.

8. Place the wooden Resource cubes and buildings (but NOT monuments) in a general supply where all players can reach them.

There are 5 different resources:

- Wood (image of a brown cube)

- Wheat (image of a yellow cube)

- Brick (image of a red cube)

- Glass (image of a blue cube)

- Stone (image of a grey cube)

9. The starting player is the player who most recently constructed something (in real life). Give that player the Master Builder hammer.

10. Shuffle the Monument cards and deal each player 2 Monument cards face-down, which they should look at but keep secret. Players should select 1 Monument card to keep and discard the other to the box, face-down.

11. Give each player 1 wooden monument (icon of a purple rectangle), which they should keep next to their Monument card. Return any remaining monuments to the box — they will not be available to players in this game. **For your first game, you may want to play without monuments.**

### recommended cards for first play (page 2)

- Cottage
- Chapel
- Farm
- Tavern
- Well
- Theater
- Factory

## Monuments (page 3)

A monument is a special type of building that can only be constructed by the player holding that card. Players may only construct their monuments once. Monuments may be constructed in any round, just like a normal building (see Building Construction Rules). Upon constructing a monument, the player should read the Monument card aloud, place it face-up in front of them, and resolve any immediate effects. If the card grants an ability, that ability takes effect immediately and only applies to the card's holder. Scoring for Monument cards is resolved at game end. Monuments are not a part of the general supply.

## Round Overview (page 4)

1. **The Master Builder names a type of resource.** (Wood, Wheat, Brick, Glass, or Stone)

2. **All players MUST take a cube of this resource and place it in an empty square in their town grid.** Players do this simultaneously.

3. **Players may construct any buildings for which they have the matching resources in the correct shape.** Players do this simultaneously and should announce what building they are constructing.

4. **Once all players have placed their resources and constructed buildings, a new round begins. The Master Builder token passes to the player on the left.**

The new Master Builder should always wait until all players are ready before naming the next resource. Players can show that they are still thinking by holding up their resource cube until they place it.

After a resource has been placed, players have until the next resource is named to construct any buildings.

### Resource Placement (page 4)

- Resources may never be moved to a different square after being placed.

- Resources can only be removed by constructing a building.

- Only 1 resource or building may occupy a square.

- When resources are removed from a board, they go back to the general supply.

### The cavern rule (page 4)

Building a Tiny Town is difficult. If this is one of your first games, or if you want a little more flexibility in your town, we recommend that you play with the Cavern rule. Throughout the game, players have the option of placing up to 2 resources named by other players off to the side of their board. These resources score no points or penalties at the end of the game. Players must decide when it is most advantageous to use this special ability!

## Building Construction Rules (page 4)

Building layouts may be mirrored/flipped and rotated, as long as the configuration of resources remains the same. To construct a building:

1. Remove the correct resources in the correct shape from your board and place them back in the general supply.

2. Take the matching wooden building from the general supply.

3. Place it in 1 of the squares that was occupied by the resources removed.

A resource can only be used to construct 1 building — in other words, every building requires all of its resources.

Buildings do not have to be constructed as soon as its resources are in place. Players may wait as many rounds as they want to construct a building.

Players may construct multiple buildings at once.

Buildings may never be moved to a different square after being placed.

Any player can construct any of the buildings (except other players' monuments). Building cards are not replaced when players construct buildings.

Players cannot construct a building immediately after a resource has been named without physically placing the resource cube in their town first.

### Building Construction Example (page 4)

> An image of a Chapel card, with a blue cube, a grey cube, a blue cube, and a grey cube at the bottom.

> An image of placing a blue cube between 2 grey cubes and another blue cube.
If John places a blue Resource cube here, he may choose to construct a Chapel.

> An image of the blue cube placed.
BLAM! Now John is ready to construct a Chapel.

> An image of all the cubes(blue and grey) removed.
 John removes the 4 cubes and can place the wooden Chapel in any of the squares they occupied. He chooses the rightmost square. Resources and other buildings may no longer be placed in that square.

> image of the 4 cubes in between each other; a blue cube, then a grey cube then a blue cube then a grey cube.
This is allowed, since the configuration of the cubes matches the Chapel card.

> Image of a blue cube, then two grey cubes, then a blue cube.
This isnt allowed, since the configuration of the cubes does not match the Chapel card.

### Feeding your cottages (page 5)

Remember! Cottages must be fed by Farm / Granary / Greenhouse / Orchard (red building icon) buildings, to be worth 3 points. Players may construct Cottages before or after constructing Farm buildings, but unfed Cottages at game end score 0 points.

## Completing Your Town (page 5)

When your town is filled with resources and you cannot (or choose not to) construct any buildings, your town is completed. You are out of the game and can start calculating your score. (You no longer take turns naming resources as the Master Builder.)

Note: A player may continue to place resources and name resources as the Master Builder as long as they have space for the resources in their town, even if it will not be possible for them to construct any buildings.

If only 1 player is left, that player can continue to name resources as the sole Master Builder until their town is completed.

## Game End (page 5)

When all players' towns are completed, the game ends immediately. **Remove all remaining resource cubes** (except from Warehouses). **Each empty square is worth -1** points. Players add their points for each building in thier town and any penalties to calculate their final score. The player with the most points wins.

In the case of a tie, the tied player who had the fewest turns as Master Builder wins. If there is still a tie, the player with the fewest empty squares wins. If there is still a tie, the player with the most Cottages wins. If there is still a tie, the tied players share the victory.

## Additional Rules (page 5)
- Resource cubes and buildings are unlimited. If you run out, substitute Some Other Marker.

- Unfed Cottages at game end remain on the board but score no Some other buildings (such as Wells) still score points from unfed Cottages.

- "Adjacent" means up, down, left, and right.

- It is possible to have a negative score.

- Farm / Granary / Greenhouse / Orchard (red building icon) buildings never Score points On Their Own.

## Scoring Example

Playing without monuments, this board would score:
| | | | |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| 2 Wells | image of a well | 1 point for each adjacent cottage (fed and unfed). | That gives 5 points |
| 4 Fed Cottages | image of a cottage | 3 points for each fed cottage. 1 Farm only feeds 4 Cottages, so only 4 of the 5 constructed Cottages score points. | That gives 12 points. |
| Chapel | image of a chapel | 1 point for each of the 4 fed cottages and 0 points for the 1 unfed cottage. | That gives 4 points. |
| 3 Taverns | image of a Tavern | 9 points for having constructed 3 taverns. |That gives 9 points. |
| Bakery | image of a Bakery | 3 points for being adjacent to a farm. | That gives 3 points. |
| Warehouse | image of a warehouse | -1 point for each resource it holds. | That gives -3 points. |
| 2 Empty squares |  | -1 point each. | That gives -2 points. |
| | | | TOTAL POINTS: 28 points. |

## Town Hall Rules (page 6)

Town Hall is a different way to play Tiny Towns that introduces the Resource deck and changes the way resources are selected during the game.

Assign 1 player to be the Mayor, who will draw Resource cards to determine which resource all players will place.

### Gameplay (page 6)

Shuffle the 15 Resource cards to form a draw pile, and discard the top 5 cards face-down to a discard pile.

1. The Mayor starts the game by drawing the top Resource card from the draw pile and placing it face-up on the table. Players must place the resource shown on the card in their town.

2. After all players have placed their resources, the Mayor places the Resource card on the discard pile and draws a new Resource card for the second round, placing it face-up on the table. All players once again place the indicated resource in their town, and the Mayor places the Resource card on the discard pile.

3. In the third round, players individually choose 1 of the 5 resources from the supply to place in their town. (Players do this simultaneously.)

In subsequent rounds repeat this pattern, with the Mayor drawing 1 Resource card each for every first and second round, and players choosing a resource individually for every third round. When a Resource card needs to be drawn and the draw pile is empty, the Mayor shuffles the cards in the discard pile to form a new draw pile and again discards the top 5 cards face-down. Play continues until the end conditions of the standard game are met.

Note: In this, Building and Monument cards that refer to other players naming resources (Factory, Warehouse, Statue of the Bondmaker) apply to rounds in which the Mayor draws a Resource card. The ongoing effect of Bank applies to every third round, in which players have their choice of resource (that is, players can no longer choose from the supply in those rounds the resources placed on any of their Banks).

If a player builds the monument Fort Ironweed, that player may no longer take and place resources every third round, in which players have their choice of resource, unless that player is the only player remaining.

## Solo Variant (page 6)

There is no Master Builder in the Solo variant.

### Setup (page 6)

Remove the following cards from the game when playing the solo variant:

The Inn, The bank, Fort Ironweed and Opaleye's Watch.

### Solo rules (page 6)

Shuffle the 15 Resource cards to form a draw pile and reveal the top 3 cards. You choose to place any 1 of the 3 resources shown in your town and construct buildings as normal. Then place the corresponding card face-down on the bottom of the draw pile and draw a new Resource card to replace it.

Note: In this variant, Building and Monument cards that refer to other players naming resources (Factory, Warehouse, Statue of the Bondmaker) apply to choosing resources from the resource deck.

The game ends as normal, when your town is completed (your town is filled with resources and you cannot or choose not to construct any buildings).

Check your score against the chart below:

|Points(VP)|Skill Level Achieved|
|----------|--------------------|
| 38 or more | Master Architect |
| 32-37 | Town Planner |
| 25-31 | Engineer |
| 18-24 | Carpenter |
| 10-17 | Builder's Apprentice |
| 9 or less | Aspiring Architect |

## Building clarifications (page 7)

### Cottage (blue building icon) (page 7)

Unfed Cottages remain on the board but do not score points on their own. Some other buildings, such as Wells, treat fed and unfed Cottages the same. You may construct Cottages even if you don't yet have a Farm / Granary / Greenhouse / Orchard (red building icon) building.

### Farm (red building icon) (page 7)

Farms feed 4 Cottages anywhere on the board.

### Granary (red building icon) (page 7)

Granaries only feed Cottages in the immediate surrounding squares (up, down, left, right, and diagonal), for a maximum of 8 Cottages.

### Greenhouse (red building icon) (page 7)

Greenhouses feed 1 contiguous group of Cottages that are adjacent (up, down, left, and right) to each other. This group does not have to be adjacent to a Greenhouse.

### Orchard (red building icon) (page 7)

Orchards will always feed a maximum of 6 Cottages no matter where they are placed.

### Fountain (grey circle icon) (page 7)

Fountains cannot score more than 2 points. Adjacent refers to up, down, left, and right, not diagonal.

### Millstone (grey circle icon) (page 7)

Millstones cannot score more than 2 points. even if they are adjacent to multiple Farm / Granary / Greenhouse / Orchard (red building icon) buildings or Bakery / Market / Tailor / Theater (yellow building icon) buildings.

### Shed (grey circle icon) (page 7)

Sheds are not restricted to being placed in the 2 squares their resources came from when constructed, but may be placed in any empty square on the board.

### Well (grey circle icon) (page 7)

Adjacent refers to up, down, left, and right, not diagonal. Adjacent fed and unfed Cottages score 1 point.

### Abbey (orange church icon) (page 7)

Abbeys like to be isolated. If an Abbey is adjacent (up, down, left, and right) to any of Almshouse / Feast Hall / Inn / Tavern (green building icon) buildings, or Bakery / Market / Tailor / Theater (yellow building icon) buildings, or Bank / Factory / Trading Post / Warehouse (black building icon) buildings, it is worth 0 points.

### Chapel (orange church icon) (page 7)

Score Chapels individually. A town with 3 fed Cottages and 1 unfed Cottage will make each Chapel worth 3 points (Chapels do not earn points for unfed Cottages.)

### Cloister (orange church icon) (page 7)

Cloisters not placed in a corner will still score 1 point for each other. Cloister placed in a corner. The maximum a Cloister can score is 4 points.

### Temple (orange church icon) (page 7)

Temples are worth 0 points if they are not adjacent to at least 2 Cottages.

### Almshouse (green building icon) (page 7)

The maximum Almshouse score is 26 points. If you construct more than 6 Almshouses, the total Almshouse score is still 26 points.

### Feast Hall (green building icon) (page 7)

If you tie with the player to your right, your Feast Halls are only worth 2 points. In a 2-player game, Feast Halls are worth 3 points to the player with the most and 2 points to the player with the least or 2 points if tied.

### Inn (green building icon) (page 7)

Inns in the same row or column are worth 0 points.

### Tavern (green building icon) (page 7)

Taverns score points as a group. For example, 4 Taverns are worth 14 points total (but can be anywhere on the board). Any Taverns constructed after the 5th Tavern do not increase your Tavern score.

### Bakery (yellow building icon) (page 7)

Adjacent refers to up, down, left, and right, not diagonal.

### Market (yellow building icon) (page 7)

Markets score for either a row or column, but not both. Markets always score 1 point for themselves in addition to any other Markets in the same row or column, for a maximum score of 4 points.

### Tailor (yellow building icon) (page 7)

Tailors not constructed in the 4 center squares are still worth 1 point plus 1 point for each other tailor in the 4 center squares. The maximum a Tailor can score in total is 5 points.

### Theater (yellow building icon) (page 7)

A Theater's score is the total number of unique building types besides Theater that share a row or column with that Theater, for a maximum score of 6 points. If there are buildings of the same type in both the same row and column as Theater, that building type only counts once toward Theater's score. Monument counts as a unique building type (unless it is Barrett Castle, which counts as 2 Cottages.

### Bank (black building icon) (page 7)

You cannot construct more than 5 Banks, since there would be no resource for them to hold.

### Factory (black building icon) (page 7)

You may choose for multiple Factories to hold the same resource, but it offers you no advantage.

### Trading Post (black building icon) (page 7)

Trading Posts can be used in the layout of any future buildings. When you construct a building that used a Trading Post as a resource, you do not remove the Trading Post from its square. You can use multiple Trading Posts to construct a single building, but at least 1 non-Trading Post resource must be used.

### Warehouse (black building icon) (page 7)

You can store up to 3 resources with a Warehouse by physically placing the cubes on the building. When another player names a resource that you do not want, place the resource on your Warehouse. You may remove a resource from your Warehouse and place it in an empty square on your board when you do this. You can never remove a resource without placing a new resource on the Warehouse. As a result, the number of resources on a Warehouse will never decrease.

## Monument Clarifications (page 8)

### Architect's Guild (monument icon) (page 8)

You may choose not to use the ability of the Architect's Guild, but you cannot use it later. The buildings you place may be the same type or 2 different types. You cannot change buildings into monuments, since they are not in the general supply.

### Archive Of The Second Age (monument icon) (page 8)

It does not matter where buildings are located for scoring this monument.

### Barrett Castle (monument icon) (page 8)

For all building scoring, Barrett Castle counts as 2 Cottages and not a Monument.

### Cathedral Of Caterina (monument icon) (page 8)

This applies only to empty squares on your own board.

### Fort Ironweed (monument icon) (page 8)

Once this monument is constructed, you may not be Master Builder and must pass the token to the player on your left, unless you are the last player in the game.

### Grove University (monument icon) (page 8)

You cannot place a monument after constructing Grove University since monuments are not in the general supply.

### Mandras Palace (monument icon) (page 8)

Adjacent refers to up, down, left, and right, not diagonal.

### Opaleye's Watch (monument icon) (page 8)

You may not choose monument as a building type for this card, since it is not in the general supply.

### Shrine Of The Elder Tree (monument icon) (page 8)

If this is the 7th or later building you construct, it still only scores 8 points.

### Silva Forum (monument icon) (page 8)

A contiguous group refers to buildings that are adjacent to one another.

### The Starloom (monument icon) (page 8)

You score the full points for 1st, 2nd, or 3rd if you complete your town in the same round as (tie with) another player.

### Statue Of The Bondmaker (monument icon) (page 8)

Resources on squares containing cottages cannot be used to construct Buildings.
